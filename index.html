            <p>
                This a case study on the UX/UI design of a health companion super app, zHealth. <br>
                The goal is to help people suffering from chronic diseases
                track their health and fitness, <br>by offering a convenient, yet powerful application.
                <br>This app will help them manage medication, track vitals,
                set reminders or schedules, and have real time communication with healthcare professionals. <br>Below is
                the
                research done on potential users, personas, and all the design stages of the app.

            <p>
                This particular project is quite relevant to me for many reasons. My 55 year-old father actually suffers
                from type 2 diabetes, and I have seen first hand how difficult it is to manage the disease. This is why
                I chose
                to interview him to get a better look into the point of view of a potential user. The second person I
                chose to interview
                was my neighbor, who is currently making use of a pacemaker to treat his heart failure. He is in in mid
                70's, and suffers
                from Bradychardia.
            </p>

            <h2> Interview with a Diabetic </h2>
            <p>For context, my father is a cloud software architect, who had suffered from diabetes ever since he was in
                his early twenties.

            <p><i>"A: Yes. I have used Samsung Health and have also tried to use a FitBit to track my health. <br>
                    The main issue with them is the clutter. I can't find what I need most of the time because the
                    important info <br>

            <p><i>"A: Well, first thing in the morning, I need my insulin. Then, I need to read my blood sugar
                    levels.<br>
                    I'd like the first thing I see to be some kind of schedule or a checklist. <br>

            <p><i>"A: Yes. The older I get, the more I neglect certain things. Notifications and alerts to my phone
                    don't help. <br>
                    I get hundreds of notifications a day, so I'm likely to ignore those. <br>

                    I found it difficult to navigate. There’s just too much information all over the place, and it feels
                    cluttered. <br>
                    I struggled to find my heart rate and medication reminders easily. <br>
                    Also, the text is too small sometimes, and my eyesight isn’t as good as it used to be."</i> </p>

                    After that, I look at my medication schedule to make sure I take everything on time. <br>
                    Sometimes I also want to see my weight because my doctor told me to watch for sudden changes. <br>
                    If all of that could be on one screen, it’d be much easier."</i> </p>

                    I'm bad with phones, and sometimes I just swipe them away without thinking. <br>
                    If the app could remind me as soon as I open it, that would be better. Maybe a checklist I can’t

            <p> Part of my research was seeing how other apps used color and style for the ebst user experience. I wanted the font sizes to be <br> 
            as readable as possible, opting for Google's `Inter` <a href = "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter">[3]</a> at an extra-bold setting, with a minimum of 20px. <br>
            The demographic for health apps is usually older, so I wanted to take into account poor vision. I also tried to use as many icons as possible, <br>
        since it makes the application more universal, regardless of the user. </p>

            <h1> Conclusion </h1>
            <h2> What I learned </h2>
            <p>Throughout this project, I learned the importance of user-centered design and how crucial it is to understand the needs and pain points of the target audience. <br>
                Conducting interviews and creating user personas helped me empathize with the users and design a solution that addresses their specific requirements.</p>
            <p>I also gained experience in creating user journey maps, wireframes, and prototypes, which are essential tools in the UX/UI design process.<br>
                These tools helped me visualize the user flow and ensure that the app is intuitive and easy to navigate.</p>
            <h2> Looking back on personas </h2>
            <p>Reflecting on the personas, I realized that each user has unique needs and preferences.<br>
                For example, Mary Thompson values medication reminders and easy communication with her doctor,<br>while Kate Kateson needs a way to manage her mother's complex medication schedule.<br>
                Rich Evans, on the other hand, focuses on monitoring his physical activity and recovery progress.</p>
            <p>By considering these diverse needs, I was able to design an app that caters to a wide range of users,<br>
                 ensuring that it is both functional and user-friendly.<br>
                 This project has reinforced the importance of user research and the impact it has on creating effective and meaningful designs.</p>
